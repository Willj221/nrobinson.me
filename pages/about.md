### CEHS Coding is a student-led club hosted on Monday afternoons in the Achievement Center.

* Club meetings are held from 2:30 to about 3:40.  The ending time may vary depending on sports or other commitments.

### CEHS Coding aims to provide students with real programming skills and valuable knowledge through practical, hands-on activities and projects.

* We will cover many topics in the club, ranging from Web Development to Embedded Firmware Engineering. Our club is student-led and the majority of topics will be taught by fellow students.  We hope to have guest speakers as well if possible.

### CEHS Coding is for anyone who is interested in technology, computers, or electronics.

* Everyone is welcome in CEHS Coding. We do not discriminate people by their interests, experience, gender, or race. We want you to get the best experience out of our club.

### CEHS Coding is a free club.

* We do not charge for sharing our knowledge and time. When we purchase hardware kits, we will require funding, but that is the future. We live in the present.

### CEHS Coding aims to make productive use of club time.

* The time we have in the Achievement Center is valuable, and we use it for our practical activities and hands-on learning. We use Slack to communicate outside of club time. Slack allows club members to message each other and share files without using E-Mail.

* Anyone who joins our Slack can join CEHS Coding. Use the Slack button below to join.
