## William Jordan
William is a freshman who's only been coding for a couple of months. His favorite place to code is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/SinBADCEHS/kx7f6e66/6/).

William uses Javascript and HTML5 for most of his projects (so far only games).

He really wants to learn more about HTML5 through this club.
