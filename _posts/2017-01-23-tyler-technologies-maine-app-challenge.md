# About the Challenge

The Maine App Challenge provides an opportunity for high school students 13 years of age and older, who are Maine residents, to create and present a mobile app of their own design for a chance to win one of three scholarships totaling $10,000. Students may use whichever program they prefer to develop their apps.

Tyler Technologies, a local technology company, brings the latest tech to the public sector. Tyler's software is used by more than 150 school districts in Maine. We hope this experience might turn a student's casual interest in software development into a college major, internship, and eventual career in the Maine computer science and technology industry.

The challenge is an empowering, hands-on learning experience requiring you to identify a purpose and its target audience, design and develop a mobile application that serves the purpose and present your application in a video for review.

Mobile apps generally fall into any combination of these three categories:

| Informational                                                                      | Utility                                                                      | Game                                                          |
