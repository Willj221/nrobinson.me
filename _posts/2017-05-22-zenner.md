Today, I, Caleb, started using a brand new Photon. I started it up and set it up using Terminal and basic bash commands.
From there, I wrote a simple program in C++ which whenever I call the Photon, it will turn on a light that is plugged in.
It worked! Afterwards, I helped some of the other students with setting up their Photons, with the help of Nathan.
Overall, a good start to my week, and hopefully I will progress more next week and be able to help more.
