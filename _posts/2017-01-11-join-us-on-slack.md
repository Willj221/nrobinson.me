We now have our very own public Slack! Slack is a messaging app for teams that allows easy communication, file sharing and integrations.

Our Slack group is [https://cehscoding.slack.com](https://cehscoding.slack.com). You can invite yourself to our Slack by using this [sign-in page](http://cehscoding.herokuapp.com/) or clicking the Slack button at the bottom of the page.

On Slack we will have club announcements, discussions about the inner workings of CEHS Coding Club, and general coding and tech discussions.

Slack can be used [on the web](https://cehscoding.slack.com) or from [any of their apps](https://slack.com/downloads). We reccomend that you get the app on your device(s) so you can easily stay in contact with other club members.

We ask that you behave appropriately on our Slack.
