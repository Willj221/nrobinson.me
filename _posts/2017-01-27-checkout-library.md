Today Nathan donated his collection of programming and Linux magazines to the library.  Anyone can now come to the library to enjoy the magazines and books.

The shelves are located on the right as you walk into the library, near the other magazine shelves.  Once the magazines are cataloged, they will be available for checking out of the library.
