# <u>Experience:</u>

### Late 2015 - Present: Particle Community Volunteer

*   Over the past two years, I have devoted much of my time to voluntarily helping members of the [Particle Community](https://community.particle.io). I directly address topics within the active community, provide assistance with code, and give feedback on Particleâ€™s tools and services.
